                                Everything is connected to the internet wirelessly, and the IoT that has dramatically improved our lives is expanding through artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of large quantities of data (often referred to as “Big-data”) collected from various devices.
                                The right figure shows the concept of such a CPS (Cyber Physical System).
                                The figure on the right shows the concept of such a CPS. Our laboratory is proceeding with the construction of a theoretical foundation and system development related to wireless communication networks and data statistical analysis (corresponding to steps (2) and (4) in the figure), which are the basic technologies underlying the IoT and CPS.
                                Furthermore, we are aware of cross-disciplinary viewpoints without being caught up in the framework of prescribed fields, for example, we are integrating statistical signal processing methods employed in wireless communication to IoT data analysis.

                                Digital wireless communication technology is indispensable for building a free, safe and secure society such as mobile phones and terrestrial TV broadcasting.
                                In a wireless environment, information is transmitted using an open space as a transmission medium, so the influence of fading that causes the envelope and phase of the received signal to change abruptly becomes prominent due to reflections from buildings and the movement of moving objects.
                                As compensation technology, we have studied and proposed channel equalization technology based on statistical signal processing in the time domain and frequency domain.
                                In recent years, we have been aiming to propose a new wireless communication method centered on the spatial domain (MIMO that adds fading in some situations).

                                In the future, wireless communication is expected to increase data communication speeds, and traffic is expected to increase compared to that in the past; therefore, there is a concern that wireless energy consumption will increase.
                                This prospect is especially a problem for battery-powered wireless nodes.
                                Therefore, we are proceeding with dynamics analysis and protocol design of wireless distributed networks that will further improve wireless energy utilization efficiency [bits / J].
                                So far, we have been comparing the performance of direct communication and multi-hop communication, analyzing the throughput of interlaced multi-hop communication, and analyzing the throughput of Wi-Fi using frame aggregation.
                                In addition, we compared the performance of ad-hoc network protocols and a simple flooding scheme.
                                Although these seem to be different problems at first glance, we are conducting research with a unified viewpoint of improving throughput and reducing energy consumption by improving wireless energy efficiency.

                                Since many disasters have caused serious damage to crop harvesting, etc., we focused on the agricultural field as a use case of IoT / AI utilization.
                                We aim to shift to digital-based agriculture. In the field of agriculture, the staple crops such as rice and rice, which are harvested once per season, have been relatively well researched.
                                On the other hand, we are promoting research that actively uses information statistics and communication technology for a comparatively unexamined crop, cultivated strawberries, which are harvested multiple times in a season.
                                Specifically, by using the proposed cultivation model and statistical learning on the data collected from an IoT network built in the local farm facilities, we can gain insight into new techniques and models that contribute to crop cultivation, such as yield prediction.
